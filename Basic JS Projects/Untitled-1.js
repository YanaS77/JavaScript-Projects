//  data  too large or sensitive and  requires servers 
// In 2009, Node.js was developed as a way to run JavaScript on servers. 
// where to place script tag - just before the closing <body> using the async or defer attributes within the script tag.
// As soon as the script is downloaded, the HTML parsing is paused and the script is executed.
// The document.write() method will not work when using the async attribute.
// The async attribute should only be used for external script files and should only be used if the src attribute is present.
// DEFER The main difference between the two attributes is that scripts with the defer attribute will be executed in order, and only after the entire document has been loaded.
// But the = value is not a declaration.  It is an initialization. 
// In our earlier example, the declaration is var X, not = 10. Only the declaration is hoisted.
// An ignorance of hoisting can lead to bugs.
